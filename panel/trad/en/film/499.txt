Glyndebourne presented in 2018 his first production of Puccini's masterpiece, which sees a geisha, young and ingenuous, fall head over heels in love with an American naval officer. But his fragile happiness can not last. Shining with memorable melodies and strong in color, the haunting partition conceals a cutting edge to the heart. When authentic Japanese music is married with voluptuous arrangements and European melodies, opera becomes an irresistible alliance between East and West.";}
