Images of the man Béjart, jostled in the administration of his troupe, leading with the incredible youth of his 75 years the rehearsals, the setting up of sets, the choice of costumes. Correcting the gesture, taking the step back, in the autumn of his life, Béjart lets his creative vigor explode in a work bringing together the musics of artists who have profoundly marked its existence: Brel, Barbara, Bach. Moving artistic testament that after "Do not leave me" Jacques Brel and "Say, when will you come back?" of Barbara, shows Maurice Béjart on a music of Bach tending the witness of his art to the child.";}
