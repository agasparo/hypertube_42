Isla Nublar has been abandoned by humans while surviving dinosaurs are left to fend for themselves in the jungle. When the island's dormant volcano begins to roar, Owen and Claire organize to save the remaining dinosaurs from extinction. Owen makes a point of finding Blue, his main raptor who has disappeared in the wild, while Claire, who now has a real respect for these creatures, makes it a mission. Arriving on the unstable island as the lava begins to rain, their expedition discovers a conspiracy that could bring our entire planet back to a perilous order never seen since prehistory.";}
