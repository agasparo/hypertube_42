Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

you stood by
and let him walk away

is not a man you find.

put a bullet through my heart.

829
01:24:36.837 --> 01:24:39.440
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

830

831

The hour.

832
01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:45.279
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

833
01:24:46.447 --> 01:24:48.683

838
01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.360

No.

I don't think I am.

841

So it's war?

842
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:09.970
You're going to war
with the High Table?

843

Unless you decide to shoot me.

845
01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:17.044
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

846

than that of an enemy.

No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

What choice?

849
01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:29.323
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

850

And I can remember her.

of the High Table.

Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

who do you wish to die as?

The Baba Yaga?

856

The last thing
many men ever see?

857
01:25:53.013 --> 01:25:57.918
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?
